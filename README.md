Story and Lore
Last boss: First part: challenge him, gives you weak weapons, find weakness
(random each time)
Goes back on word, really coward (only powerful cuz of wizard)
Fight through hordes of 1-hit goblins as he makes escape
Finally face him,
Driven by wizard powering - kill orc king, see wizard wounded and retreating
Orcs only respect power, thats why they challenge the best humans
